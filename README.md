# Leetcode Racer

## Project Overview

Welcome to Leetcode Racer, an engaging and competitive coding platform inspired by LeetCode. Leverage your coding skills, compete with others, and enhance your problem-solving abilities. Our unique matchmaking system pairs participants based on proficiency, fostering a challenging and fair competition.

## Accessing the Frontend

Visit [Leetcode Racer](http://34.68.28.7:3000/) to access the platform.

## Getting Started (for grading purposes only)

To simulate a pair of opponents and test the functionality of Leetcode Racer, follow these steps:

1. **Create Two Accounts:**
   - Visit [Leetcode Racer](http://34.68.28.7:3000/) in your web browser.
   - Sign up for a new account as the first opponent.
   - Open an incognito browser window and sign up for a second account as the second opponent.

2. **Match the Opponents:**
   - Log in to the first account in the regular browser window.
   - Log in to the second account in the incognito browser window.
   - In both browsers, choose the same coding category and question difficulty.
   - Initiate the matchmaking process to find an opponent.

3. **Start Coding:**
   - Once the opponents are matched, they will proceed to the editor and question room.
   - Both users can click "I'm ready" to proceed to the next screen.

4. **Chat and Discuss:**
   - In the chat room, users can communicate with each other.
   - Discuss your approach to the problem, share tips, and talk about your coding strategies.

By following these steps, you can simulate a pair of opponents, test the matchmaking functionality, and evaluate the collaborative coding experience on Leetcode Racer.
